### Project Description

[WOMEN EMPOWERMENT - THE  SITE WOULD BASED  SOLUTION FOR THE ENTIRE GIRLS OF THE WORLD. THE GIRLS WOULD FACE ANXIETY, STRESS , AND  DISTRESS IN THEIR PEROID TIME , SO IN ORDER TO THE MAKE SAFE . WE TEAM SPARKLES ENSURE THAT THE A SITE WHICH ENSURES THAT THE   NO WOMEN WOULD FEEL  UNSAFE OR BLAMED BECAUSE OF THIS REASONS . OUR MOTTO AND THEME IS FOR THAT THE WOMEN PROTECTION FOR IT.]

### The Problem statement
[Many women face difficulty in managing menstrual health, especially in public spaces, colleges, workplaces, or during travel. Access to sanitary pads during emergencies is often limited, and asking for help can feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Additionally, existing period tracking applications do not provide real-time community-based emergency support while ensuring user privacy and safety.?]

### The Solution
[We propose a women-friendly web platform that combines period tracking with an emergency support system. The platform allows users to track their menstrual cycle while also providing a feature to request sanitary pads in urgent situations. When a user requests help, the system accesses their current location (with permission) and notifies nearby verified users who are willing to help.

For user safety and privacy, the frontend initially appears as a simple calculator interface, ensuring discreet access. Only authenticated users can access the main features. This ensures safety, anonymity, and secure communication between users.

The platform promotes community support, menstrual awareness, and women empowerment through technology.?]
